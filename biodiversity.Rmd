## Data Sources

To evaluate the potential tourist-vessel collision risk for five cetacean species regularly observed in Colombia, we conducted habitat modeling analyses for the following species:

* Atlantic spotted dolphin (*S. frontalis*) for the Caribbean Sea only, as it is endemic to the Atlantic Ocean [@Herzing2018].

* Humpback whale (*M. novaeangliae*) for the Pacific Ocean only, as the Colombian Pacific coast serves as part of the breeding zone for stock G [@Acevedo2017; @Avila2020].

* Bottlenose dolphin (*T. truncatus*) for both Caribbean and Pacific basins.

* Pantropical spotted dolphin (*S. attenuata*) for both basins, but occurrences were separated by subspecies distribution: the offshore pantropical spotted (S. a. attenuata) was analyzed in both basins, while the coastal pantropical spotted (*S. a. graffmani*) was modeled for coastal records in the Pacific basin only, as it is exclusive to the coastal waters of the eastern tropical Pacific [@Jefferson2015; @Perrin2018].

* Spinner dolphin (*S. longirostris*) for both basins, separated by subspecies distribution: the Gray’s spinner (*S. l. longirostris*) for the Caribbean basin, the Eastern spinner (*S. l. orientalis*) for coastal occurrences in the Pacific basin, and the Central American spinner (S. l. centroamericana) for offshore occurrences in the Pacific basin [@Forney2012; @Jefferson2015].

To locate information on the subspecies, a search was conducted using the complete name of each subspecies. The following databases were used: Atlas of Living Australia (ALA, http://www.ala.org.au/), Berkeley Ecoengine (Ecoengine, [https://ecoengine.berkeley.edu/](https://ecoengine.berkeley.edu/)), Biodiversity Information Serving Our Nation (BISON, [https://bison.usgs.gov/](https://bison.usgs.gov/)), Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF,[https://www.gbif.org](https://www.gbif.org) ), Integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio, [https://www.idigbio.org/](https://www.idigbio.org/)), iNaturalist (iNat, [http://www.inaturalist.org/](http://www.inaturalist.org/)), the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS, [https://obis.org](https://obis.org)), Distributed Databases with Backbone (VertNet, [http://vertnet.org/](http://vertnet.org/)), *Sistema de Información Ambiental Marina* (SIAM, [http://siam.invemar.org.co](http://siam.invemar.org.co)) operated by Colombia's Marine and Coastal Research Institute *INVEMAR*, and the *Red Nacional de Datos Abiertos sobre Biodiversidad de Colombia* (*SiB Colombia*, [https://sibcolombia.net/](https://sibcolombia.net/))

In addition to the publicly available databases, our study also utilized unpublished data from oceanographic cruises conducted by the *National Maritime Directorate of Colombia* (*DIMAR*) as part of the El Niño Southern Oscillation Regional Study (*ERFEN*). The data was collected by the *Centro de Investigaciones Oceanográficas e Hidrográficas del Pacífico* (*CCCP*) and can be found in the supplementary table 1.

The removal of duplicate records and the filtering of the datasets were performed using a script in the R programming language and packages such as "*tidyverse*"(v. 1.2.0; @Wickham2017), "*dplyr*"(v. 1.0; @Wickham2019), "*anytime*" (v. 0.3.7; @Eddelbuettel2020), "*rgdal*"  (v. 1.5-12; @Bivand2020), "*gdata*" (v. 2.18.0; @Warnes2012), and "*devtools*" (v. 2.3.1; @Wickham2020).

## Data thinning and bias removal.

Para todos los conjuntos de datos de los registros de ocurrencias de las especies, se llevó a cabo un análisis de adelgazamiento espacial usando el paquete de R "spThin" [@Aiello-Lammens2015], el cual permite
