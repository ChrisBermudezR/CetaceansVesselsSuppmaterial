Based on previous cetacean niche modeling analyses (*e.g.*, @Barragan2019; @Amaral2015; @Tobena2016), dynamic and topographical type predictors data layers were selected (Table 1; Supplementary Figure 1).\

The topographical or static predictors included topographic features such as bathymetry and slope, as well as the distance to the main bottom geomorphological characteristics such as the continental shelf (Dist_Shelf), oceanic ridges (Dist_Ridges), oceanic trenches (Dist_Trenches), and seamounts (Dist_seamounts).\

To create these topographic predictors, the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans source (GEBCO, <https://www.gebco.net/>) was used for bathymetry, and the slope was derived from this layer, using the "Slope" tool from the spatial extension analyst of the ESRI's ArcGIS® program (v. 10.6; @ESRI2017).
Layers for the other geomorphological characteristics were derived from the Seafloor Geomorphic Feature Map (<https://www.bluehabitats.org/?page_id=9>) [@Harris2014], and distance calculations were obtained using the "Euclidean Distance" tool from the spatial analyst extension of ESRI's ArcGIS® program (v. 10.6; @ESRI2017) (Table 1; Supplementary Figure 1).

Among dynamic predictors, we included the attenuation coefficient (At_coef), mixed-layer depth (Mixed_Layer), sea bottom temperature (Bottom_T), sea current speed (Vel_current), surface primary production (PP), sea surface salinity (Sal), and sea surface temperature (Temp).
To create these predictors, we used data from 1993-01-01 to 2019-06-25 with 8.5 km spatial resolution from the E.U.
Copernicus Marine Service Information: Global Ocean Physics Reanalysis Glorys 12V1 (PHYS 001-030) (<https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/?option=com_csw&task=results>).\

Data was downloaded in NetCDF format and was processed with the Climate Data Operator (CDO) command for Linux Ubuntu v. 18.4.
For each variable, the mean and standard deviation were calculated, maintaining the same spatial resolution (Table 1; Supplementary Figure 1).

All environmental raster layers were processed in the R program [@RTeam2008] using the "*raster*" package (v.3.4-10; @Hijmans2020). In order to avoid area calculation errors [@Sillero2021], all layers were projected to the Robinson coordinate system, maintaining the same spatial extent (north: 1885709.906800 m, south: -1595010.207100 m, east: -5625484.156700 m, west: -8664897.024700 m) and the same grid resolution (8.5 km) (Supplementary Figure 1).\

To prevent overfitted models, the variables' selection was conducted using a heuristic approach [@Cobos2019]. For this, a pairwise Spearman's correlation matrix was built first to detect a statistical correlation between environmental predictors used in the habitat suitability models. Because two of the selected cetacean species and one subspecies only occur in one of the two ocean basins within Colombian EEZ, it was necessary to perform this analysis on two data sets, each one with layers that represented only the Caribbean and the Pacific, respectively. This analysis was performed using the "*corrplot*" package in the R program (v.0.84; @Wei2017). Posteriorly and using all previously uncorrelated environmental predictors, several runs for predictors testing were made using the Maximum Entropy algorithm [MaxEnt; @Elith2011; @Gomes2018; @Phillips2006] with the default settings (*e.g.*, randomly generated background, non cross-validation for replicates) to identify the most contributing predictors to each species/subspecies model based on the importance value higher than 0.05. MaxEnt allows discriminating among predictors for each species, since its analysis is based on background data to build habitat suitability models [@Hirzel2002], finding the environmental conditions with the maximum entropy at recorded species sightings spots using a log-linear model [@Merow2013; @Merow2014].
Finally, environmental predictors with an importance value less than 0.05 were excluded, so remaining predictors were selected to conduct habitat suitability models based on previous studies, each cetaceans' species/subspecies ecology, and their natural history (Table 1) [@Redfern2017].
Furthermore, and starting from the hypothesis that seabed features and dynamic oceanographic conditions influence the distribution of marine cetaceans, we selected environmental predictors that remained within the dolphins and baleen whales limits of meso and macro scales-of-sense (from 10 km to 1,000 km in distance) [@Torres2017].
