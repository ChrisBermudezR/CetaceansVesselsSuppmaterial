## Data sources

To create the topographic predictors, *General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans*  (GEBCO, [https://www.gebco.net/](https://www.gebco.net/)) and the *Seafloor Geomorphic Feature Map* ([https://www.bluehabitats.org/?page_id=9](https://www.bluehabitats.org/?page_id=9)) [@Harris2014] were used as spatial data sources. All these data were manually downloaded.

The main data source to obtain the dynamic predictors was the *Copernicus Marine Service Information* ([<https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/?option=com_csw&task=results](https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/?option=com_csw&task=results)). The data were downloaded automatically through a [script](https://github.com/ChrisBermudezR/Cetacean_Tourist_Vessel_Collision_Risk_Assessment/blob/main/03_Predictors/01_NetCDF/01_Predictors_Download.py) built in the Python programming language using the [MINICONDA](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) frame and the [MOTU](https://help.marine.copernicus.eu/en/articles/4796533-what-are-the-motu-apis#h_3d33beaafc) Client API of the *Copernicus Marine Service*. 



## Data Processing

### Topographic predictors

The GEBCO bathymetry data were used to obtain a bathymetric layer of the study area, this was cut to the boundaries of this area with the "Extract by Mask" tool of the Spatial Analyst extension of the ESRI ArcGIS® program (v. 10.6; @ESRI2017). To obtain the derived slope topographic layer from the GEBCO data, the "Slope" tool of the Spatial Analyst extension of the ESRI ArcGIS®(v. 10.8.1; @ESRI2017) program was used. 

To obtain the layers based on distance to the main geomorphological features, such as "Distance to coast" or "Distance to continental shelf", the "Euclidean Distance" tool of the Spatial Analyst extension of ESRI's ArcGIS® software (v. 10.8.1; @ESRI2017) was used. To obtain these layers and calculate the distances in a proper way and decreasing the calculation errors, first the original projection of the geographic coordinate data (WGS84) was transformed to planar coordinates with the projection Robinson coordinate system using the "Project" tool of the Data Management Tools extension of ESRI's ArcGIS®(v. 10.8.1; @ESRI2017). Once the distance layer was obtained, it was re-projected to geographic coordinates (WGS84) to match the projection of the rest of the data (e.g. Biodiversity and Dynamic data).

### Dynamic predictors

For the dynamic layers, the choice of variables was based on the general ecology of cetacean species, taking into account the sensory scale that these species may present in the chosen study area. We relied on the work of @Torres2017 to determine which variables could be part of the modeling according to the distance at which cetacean species, both dolphins and whales, could sense the environment. For both dolphins and whales, the variables that can be sensed by these species at a distance of more than 10 km (minimum area at which the resolution of the geographic layers is presented) are those that stimulate somatosensory perception and chemoreception [@Torres2017]. 

To obtain the dynamic predictor layers, we used data for nine variables obtained from the **Copernicus Marine Service Information: Global Ocean Physics Reanalysis Glorys 12V1 (PHYS 001-030)** from two datasets. **cmems_mod_glo_bgc_my_0.083deg-lmtl_PT1D-i** and **cmems_mod_glo_phy_my_0.083_P1M-m**. The temporal resolution of the data was monthly with a time window from 1993-01-01 to 2020-05-31. The spatial resolution of the data was 8.5 km (0.085°) and data were extracted not only at the surface but also at depths up to 200 meters, trying to cover the entire epipelagic layer of the ocean where dolphin and whale species have the greatest foraging activity [@Coram2021].

The variables selected were as follows:

1. Mass content of epipelagic micronekton expressed as wet weight in sea water (mnkc_epi [g/m2])
2. Euphotic zone depth (zeu [m])
3. Sea water potential temperature at sea floor (bottomT [°C])
4. Sea surface height above geoid (zos [m])
5. Ocean mixed layer thickness defined by sigma theta (mlotst [m])
6. Sea water potential temperature (thetao [°C])
7. Sea water salinity (so [10-3])
8. Eastward sea water velocity (uo [m/s])
9. Northward sea water velocity (vo [m/s])



Once these data were downloaded in NetCDF format, they were all processed with the linux program **Climate Data Operator - CDO** to obtain the mean and standard deviation in time and depth of all variables in the study area. To calculate the magnitude of the currents, it was derived from the Eastward sea water velocity and the Northward sea water velocity with the following equation: $|v| = \sqrt{(uo)^2 + (vo)^2}$
 
 
After this, all environmental raster layers were processed in the R program [@RTeam2008] using the "*raster*" package (v.3.4-10; [@Hijmans2020]). In order to avoid area calculation errors [@Sillero2021], all layers were projected to the Robinson coordinate system, maintaining the same spatial extent (north: 1885709.906800 m, south: -1595010.207100 m, east: -5625484.156700 m, west: -8664897.024700 m) and the same grid resolution (8.5 km).



## Selection of Environmental predictors










 (Supplementary Figure 1).\

To prevent overfitted models, the variables' selection was conducted using a heuristic approach [@Cobos2019]. For this, a pairwise Spearman's correlation matrix was built first to detect a statistical correlation between environmental predictors used in the habitat suitability models. Because two of the selected cetacean species and one subspecies only occur in one of the two ocean basins within Colombian EEZ, it was necessary to perform this analysis on two data sets, each one with layers that represented only the Caribbean and the Pacific, respectively. This analysis was performed using the "*corrplot*" package in the R program (v.0.84; @Wei2017). Posteriorly and using all previously uncorrelated environmental predictors, several runs for predictors testing were made using the Maximum Entropy algorithm [MaxEnt; @Elith2011; @Gomes2018; @Phillips2006] with the default settings (*e.g.*, randomly generated background, non cross-validation for replicates) to identify the most contributing predictors to each species/subspecies model based on the importance value higher than 0.05. MaxEnt allows discriminating among predictors for each species, since its analysis is based on background data to build habitat suitability models [@Hirzel2002], finding the environmental conditions with the maximum entropy at recorded species sightings spots using a log-linear model [@Merow2013; @Merow2014].
Finally, environmental predictors with an importance value less than 0.05 were excluded, so remaining predictors were selected to conduct habitat suitability models based on previous studies, each cetaceans' species/subspecies ecology, and their natural history (Table 1) [@Redfern2017].
Furthermore, and starting from the hypothesis that seabed features and dynamic oceanographic conditions influence the distribution of marine cetaceans, we selected environmental predictors that remained within the dolphins and baleen whales limits of meso and macro scales-of-sense (from 10 km to 1,000 km in distance) [@Torres2017].
